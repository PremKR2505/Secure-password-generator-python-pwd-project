### Problem Statement
Most password generators produce random strings that are either too weak, too hard to remember, or don’t meet specific website/application requirements (e.g., must contain at least one symbol, uppercase letter, or even a mandatory keyword). Users often resort to insecure workarounds or manually editing generated passwords, reducing overall security.
